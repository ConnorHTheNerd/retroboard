# Retroboard

Retroboard is a Eurovision scoreboard simulator which allows you to emulate the style of the older contests. This board has no re-ordering like modern boards do, and has a classic design which makes it similar to those of the older contests.

## Changelog

### v0.0.1a (29/07/2025)

- Created scoreboard with test countries (based on the 1957 countries); these will be updated to real ones with the board but the humour is the only thing keeping me going at 03:26
- Added basic voting logic to the board, click to assign points to each country (NOTE: there is no real logic behind the voting other than allowing you to assign points wherever)
- Added (non-functioning) reset button (if you want to reset the board, refresh)
- Added capability for the voting country to be shown by way of a light next to the running order, although this has not yet been implemented fully
